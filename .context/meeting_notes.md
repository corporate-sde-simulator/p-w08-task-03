# Meeting Notes - Sprint 30 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Vikram Patel (Lead), Suresh, Intern

---

## Graceful shutdown orchestrator

- **Vikram Patel:** This is blocking our release. Suresh started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Suresh:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `shutdownOrchestrator.go` and `resourceManager.go`
- [ ] @Suresh - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Vikram Patel - Final sign-off before merge
